## 0.20260302.0 - Dynamic Embedding Dimensions

### Breaking Changes

- The static `memories` table has been replaced by dimension-specific tables (`memories_384`, `memories_768`, `memories_1536`, etc.). Existing databases with a bare `memories` table require a one-time rename: `ALTER TABLE memories RENAME TO memories_1536;`

### New Features

- **Dynamic embedding dimensions** - Formations can now use any embedding model regardless of its output dimension. The runtime automatically creates and manages dimension-specific memory tables (`memories_{dim}`), so a 384-dim local model and a 1536-dim OpenAI model can coexist in the same database without conflicts.
- **Local embedding model support** - Added `local/` prefix for embedding models (e.g., `local/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `local/all-mpnet-base-v2`). The runtime downloads and runs these models locally via `sentence-transformers`, with no API key required.
- **Embedding migration script** - New `scripts/migrate_embeddings.py` re-embeds memories from one dimension to another (e.g., 1536 to 384) without data loss. Source table is preserved.
- **SQLite local embedding fallback** - SQLite-backed formations now fall back to local embeddings automatically instead of raising an error when no API-based embedding model is configured.

### Improvements

- **Memory model factory** - `get_memory_model(dimension)` dynamically generates SQLAlchemy ORM models per dimension, replacing the hardcoded `Memory` class.
- **Knowledge handler dimension resolution** - The knowledge handler now derives embedding dimensions from the formation config rather than assuming 1536.
- **`search_text()` uses dynamic table names** - Raw SQL in `long_term.py` now references `self.MemoryModel.__tablename__` instead of a hardcoded table name.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed all raw SQL references to bare `memories` table across 11 e2e test files and 1 runtime file
- Fixed FK constraint violations during test cleanup when legacy `memories` table was absent
- Fixed FAISS buffer crash (SIGSEGV) in e2e tests caused by rapid sequential message adds at sub-second intervals
- Fixed safety-critical memory recall test (8d1) with improved extraction wait time and retry logic
